Python Script Guide:

dragonScript1KEFF.py is a script that calculates the KEFF value for a line of pincell input information as in inputFile.txt and returns a line of pincell output information
dragonScriptKEFFfile.py runs dragonScript1KEFF.py on multiple cases such as those in inputFile.txt and returns a csv file of pincell output information lines
runPins.py runs dragonScriptKEFFfile.py over a list of libraries given as lines in a .txt file such as the ones found in the dragon/Libs directory
MultKEFF.py is a script that calculates the KEFF value for a line of assembly input information as in inputASSBLYFile1.txt or inputASSBLYFile.txt and returns a line of assembly output information
MultKEFFfile.py runs MultKEFF.py on multiple cases such as those in inputASSBLYFile1.txt or inputASSBLYFile.txt and returns a csv file of assembly information lines
runDirs.py runs MultKEFFfile.py over a list of libraries given as lines in a .txt file such as the ones found in the dragon/Libs
 directory
copyScript.py and runCopyScript.py were used to copy all the output tables mentioned above into one csv file. Note that these require an empty table with geometries and libraries predefined.
